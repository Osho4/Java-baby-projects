/*Question 1: Write a program in Java to input a number and check whether it is a Prime Number or not. 
A Prime Number is one which has got only two factors (1 & itself) e.g. 3, 5, 7 etc… 
any number having more than two factors is called a Composite Number e.g. 10, 12, 100 etc…

                                      SOURCE CODE*/

/*1ST SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
 
Enter a number:
57
 57 is not a Prime Number
 
 *2ND SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
Enter a number:
67
 67 is a Prime Number
